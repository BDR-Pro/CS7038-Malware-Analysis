## {{page.title}}

This lecture primarily focused on building yara signatures for detection through static
analysis, and also documenting interesting findings from your analysis. In particular,
we focused on cataloging the sample, creating an initial malware report template, and
performing analysis of the **strings** data from the file.

**Unfortunately, lecture video needs to be re-recorded for this topic**

We analyzed the following malware sample:

```
1bc9ab02d06ee26a82b5bd910cf63c07b52dc83c4ab9840f83c1e8be384b9254  VirusShare_f7f85d7f628ce62d1d8f7b39d8940472
```

Our findings were documented in the following malware report

* [ex1.ltx (LaTeX Source)](/code/ex1.ltx)
* [ex1.pdf (PDF final)](/code/ex1.pdf)

After some work, we created the following yara rule (signature) to identify it.

Here is documentation for Yara on the syntax below: [http://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/writingrules.html](http://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/writingrules.html)

```perl
rule ex1_rule {
 meta:
  author = "Coleman Kane"

 strings:
  /* Malicious strings */
  $mal_seturl2 = "seturl2"
  $mal_seturl1 = "seturl1"
  $mal_setsleep = "setsleep"
  $mal_makefile = "makefile"
  $mal_mkcmdshell = "mkcmdshell"
  $mal_mkcmdload = "mkcmdload"
  $mal_mkcmdrun = "mkcmdrun"
  $mal_mkcmddown = "mkcmddown"
  $mal_mkcmddownrun = "mkcmddownrun"
  $mal_mkcmdsleep = "mkcmdsleep"

  /* Strings identifying legit programs. */
  $legit_mcafee = "McAfee Anti-Virus"

 condition:
  4 of ($mal_*) and 0 of ($legit_*)

}
```

Our yara rule identified two more "similar" samples in our library:

```


I provided a very simple malware analysis LaTeX template here, that could be used for
future work:

* [mw_report.ltx](/code/mw_report.ltx)

My current approach has been to use the following steps to create a new report from the
above template and generate a PDF from it:

```bash
cp mw_report.ltx sample1_exe.ltx
vim sample1_exe.ltx # Open new report in editor, and make changes
```

Once you've filled in your report details, then you could use latex to author it into
a PDF document named <code>sample1_exe.pdf</code>:
```bash
latex sample1_exe.ltx
latex sample1_exe.ltx
dvipdf sample1_exe.dvi
```

A common problem that can arise is when you are analyzing your malware samples and extracting interesting
content, it is not always readily apparent what is and is not a significant finding. A non-significant
finding would be, for example, a string from a malware sample that also happens to show up in NOTEPAD.EXE,
CMD.EXE, or any other common windows program. In order to determine whether something is significant or
not, it is helpful to build up a folder of benign program samples which you can use to tune and test your
yara rules against.

There are many ways to build such a database, but a very quick method that yields pretty good results is
to simply copy all of the EXE and DLL files from a windows installation. So, I have put together a database
to test my rules using VirtualBox and my Windows XP VM. You can, however, use whatever works best for you.

Following the below steps, I was able to export all of these EXE's and DLL's into on big folder. Make sure
you are using one of the "clean" Windows VM images, and not one that you may have already loaded malware
into.

1. Create a new folder called "benign-exe" on your host system
2. Using VirtualBox VM Shared Folder settings, map this new directory to a shared folder of the same name
3. Boot up your VM (if it is not already running)
4. Once Windows is up and running, open a new explorer window and enter "\\\\VBOXSVR\" in the location bar
5. You should see the folder named "benign-exe" in the window
6. Right click on the "benign-exe" and choose "Map Network Drive..." and a dialog will pop up asking you
   what drive letter you'd like to map it to.
7. Choose Z: (or whatever you want, but keep track of the choice you've made)

Once the above is done, you should open a command prompt. A common way to do this is using the Start menu
and choosing "Run" and then entering "CMD.EXE", or navigating to the Command Prompt shortcut in the menu.

Following that, type the following command into the prompt, and it will take some time but eventually it
will finish copying all of your Windows EXE's and DLL's into the VBox shared folder:

```dos
C:
CD \
FOR /R %x in (*.exe, *.dll) DO COPY /Y %x Z:\
```

Once the job is complete, you will no longer need to be running your Windows VM. Your host system will
now have a copy of all of the DLLs and EXEs from your windows VM, and you may share this folder with your
Remnux VM.

Once mounted in Remnux (at a folder named benign-exe), you may test any yara signature against this data
set using the following command (the -s option displays all matching content, while the -r option
recursively searches all files in the directory):
```sh
yara -s -r myrule.yar benign-exe/
```

In this case, your goal is to make sure that you can build a yara rule with the following characteristics:

* It matches on your malware sample(s)
* It does not match on **any** files in benign-exe/

[home](/)
