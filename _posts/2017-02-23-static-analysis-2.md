This lecture dove deeper into static analysis, leveraging tools like <code>objdump</code>
and [IDA Free](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml) to
explore the executable code in the sample of malware we bgan with during the
[Wk07.1 lecture](/2017/02/21/static-analysis-1.html). As with the prior lecture, there
is no slide deck for this particular talk.

We explore the following features in IDA Free:

* Loading new samples to analyze
* Exploring the CFG
* Navigating the function list
* Navigating the strings list
* Pivoting using xrefs
* Adding comments
* Labeling data and variables
* Converting encodings

Additionally, we created additional yara data to add to our earlier yara rule:

```perl
rule ex1_bin { 
 strings:
  $xyloop = { 68 ?? ?? ?? ?? ff 75 0c ff 15 90 40 40 00 59 85 c0 59 77 0a ff 45 0c 39 5d 0c 72 e4 }
  $b64_setup = { 8b 45 f8 6a 10 59 8b f3 8d bd dc fe ff ff 8b 10 f3 a5 8b c2 c1 e8 02 83 e0 3f a4 7c 0e }
 condition:
  any of them
}
```
