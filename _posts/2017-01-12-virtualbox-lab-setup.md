## {{page.title}}

This lecture really dives more into using VirtualBox for creating VMs, and configuring the
simulated hardware they will run on. Common features that VirtualBox's hypervisor offers
are explored, with a focus on the components that will be useful in malware analysis.

In this lecture we discuss and demonstrate:

* Creating a new VM from scratch, and installing an OS from a DVD UDF/ISO image
* Importing a VM that was created by another author, using the "*Import Appliance*" feature
* Discussion of using the UC-licensed Windows 10 image for a new VM
* Some useful Linux distributions
* Exporting a VirtualBox Appliance to share with others
* VirtualBox Snapshots
* VirtualBox Virtual Networking options

VirtualBox, though supported by Oracle, is also a community-driven project as well. There
are some helpful links that I recommend you bookmark and use in the future. People just
like you all contribute to make it a great piece of software, and if you feel you have
an improvement to recommend or provide, don't hesitate to collaborate with their community.
