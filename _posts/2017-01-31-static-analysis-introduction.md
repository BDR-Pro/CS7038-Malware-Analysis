This lecture introduces some basic utilities for performing static analysis
on a malware sample.

We begin by discussing file structures, and proceed to discuss the structure
characteristics for the following open-source-defined file formats:

* [PNG Files](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#5DataRep)
* [MS Windows PE32 (EXE and DLL) Files](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly/Windows_Executable_Files#PE_Files)
* [MS Office CFB Files (DOC, XLS, PPT, etc.)](https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-CFB/[MS-CFB].pdf)

Furthermore, we go on to describe some models that we will use to describe
data structure as the course goes on. The following page describes the
*Backus-Naur Form* that we discussed in class. This should be familiar
to many of your from Automata or Compiler Theory classes:  
[http://matt.might.net/articles/grammars-bnf-ebnf/](http://matt.might.net/articles/grammars-bnf-ebnf/)

We then discuss Structured vs. Unstructured data and the technique of
data extraction (or, sometimes, *feature extraction*).

Following that, we proceed to demonstrate the use of the following utilities
in [Remnux](https://remnux.org) to provide this capability to us:

* [objdump from GNU binutils](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.23/binutils/objdump.html)
* [strings from GNU binutils](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.23/binutils/strings.html)
* [Perl Image::ExifTool](http://exiftool.sourceforge.net/)
