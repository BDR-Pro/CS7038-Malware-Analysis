This assignment will build upon HW04 by having you use IDA Free or any
other tool you wish to use, to identify one or more blocks of code to
write a yara signature that performs a binary pattern match.

You will need to provide the sample Id (filename, or checksum) of the malware sample
you built the rule from, as well as the location in the file/program that the
binary code was identified. Include the disassembly (the x86 instructions)
for the code that you're matching.

In this example, you will work off of the malware samples you picked for
HW04. Build a yara signature with at least four strings demonstrating
the following features in yara, and matching on at least four different
places within the program code. Feel free to simply expand your strings signature
from HW04 for this submission.

* Static binary data (so, no wildcards)
* Binary data containing wild cards (? and ??)
* Binary data containing ranges (using the [] and numbers)
* Binary data containing byte alternatives <tt>( 45 | 46 | 67 | ... | )</tt>

In the [Yara Documentation, these are called Hexadecimal Strings](http://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/writingrules.html#hexadecimal-strings).

Your new rule may also match other malware samples. Include a list of all matching samples in your submission.

Unlike the strings analysis, you will not be required to restrict your hexadecimal strings to not detect on any legitimate windows
programs.
