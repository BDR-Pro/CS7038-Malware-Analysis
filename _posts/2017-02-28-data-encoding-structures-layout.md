## {{page.title}}

This lecture introduces the class to the common methods of data representation/encoding within
the machine architecture. We focus on the schemes common in x86-64 architectures. We discuss
numeric encoding methods, how characters are encoded as bytes, and how signed and unsigned
numbers are stored.

Also discussed is how data is organized in arrays, unidimensional and multidimensional. Additionally,
we discuss the nuances of pointer-indirect (<tt>char \*\*blah</tt>, for instance) and
dynamically-allocated multi-dimensional arrays.

We demonstrate using the GDB debugger to analyze all of this data, compiled into a C++ program,
at run-time in memory.

Here's a good discussion on how *Two's Complement* encoding is used to represent signed numbers:

Here's some documentation about using GDB to analyze (eXamine) memory, using the <tt>x</tt> command,
as well as help on using it for run-time analysis:

* [Examining Memory in GDB](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Memory.html)
* [Stack analysis with GDB](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/stack-analysis-with-gdb/)
