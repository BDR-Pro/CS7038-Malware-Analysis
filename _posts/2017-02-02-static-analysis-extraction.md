## {{page.title}}

This lecture builds off of the [Wk04.1](/2016/1/31/static-analysis-introduction.html)
lecture by demonstrating how to use the tools introduced in that lecture in the
construction of a tool for data management and ingestion.

Some key elements of MongoDB are introduced. More information is available here:
[MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/)

Some existing open-source malware management platforms that we use as production examples:

* [CRITs](https://crits.github.io/)
* [MISP](http://www.misp-project-org/)

We discuss how collection requirements are defined to give direction to what analysis
is to be performed on a sample. From that, we integrate our tools from Tuesday's
discussion into a single script that performs the data extraction, normalization, and
storage (into MongoDB) steps for us. We then demonstrate using that script on an
entire directory of malware:

~~~
cd test_samples
ls -1U | xargs -n 1 ../metadata_import.py -f
~~~

The script is available here, and will be used in [HW03](2017/02/05/static-analysis-utility.html):
[metadata_import.py](code/metadata_import.py)

Once the data has been ingested, we are able to perform broad analysis across the
entire dataset using single queries.
