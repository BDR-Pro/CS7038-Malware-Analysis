On Tuesday, we walked through using features in VirtualBox to import, snapshot, and configure networking on the Kali VM. I have configured a Win7 VM that is
linked in the courseware announcement. The VM is configured to use NAT by default (similar to how Kali was configured) and already has `ncat.exe` installed.

This independent lab will have you achieve the following goals - you'll want to use (`tcpdump -w` as we demoed in class, on the Kali VM, to capture the traffic):

Configure the networking to use Host-Only Network, and using the same VirtualBox/vboxnet host network that Kali is configured to use.
* a) Ensure that you can run both VMs, and try to ping one VM to the other, identifying the pings are responded to
* b) Use `ncat.exe` on the Windows system as a listener (-l, -p  options) and connect to it from the Kali VM, and type a short message across the connection that includes your UC username
* c) Use `ncat.exe` on the Windows system, as a listener, and use `cmd.exe`, `python.exe`, or `powershell.exe` (your choice) to create a simple remote shell that you connect to from your Kali VM.
Use this channel to write a new file named "myoutput.txt" onto the Windows 7's Desktop, and this file may contain whatever you want, but needs to at least contain your username.

Attach a ZIP file containing the PCAP generated by `tcpdump`, and also the `output.txt` file, as the submission for this assignment.
Method #2 from [This Example](https://www.petri.com/quickly_create_txt_file_from_cmd)
might be helpful if you're using `cmd.exe` and want a tip on how to accomplish the file write operation without a GUI.
