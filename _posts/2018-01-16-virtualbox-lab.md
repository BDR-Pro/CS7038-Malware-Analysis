This lecture builds upon the concepts discussed in the following lecture from
2017:
* [2017-01-12 VirtualBox Lab Setup and Crash Course](/2017/01/12/virtualbox-lab-setup.html)

The topics covered in this lecture included how to work with the following features
of VirtualBox:
* Snapshots / VM cloning
* Appliance Import &amp; Export
* Virtual Networking
 * NAT - Relay all requests transparently through your host computer to the Internet
 * Internal Network - Network switch hidden from host computer, you give it a short name, and
   all VMs running with an Internal Network of the same name will behave as if they were
   all plugged into the same physical switch
 * Host-Only Network - Associated with a virtual network interface on the host. Much like
   "Internal Network" above, except that the host computer also has a software adapter
   connected to the virtual switch, making the virtual network accessible to the host as well
* Shared Folders (requires VirtualBox Guest Additions to be installed inside VM)
* Throttling CPU (to conserve resources)

When working with Windows VMs, it can be helpful to adjust the VM with the following changes,
to eliminate possible interference with malware and noise in network traffic:
* Disable "Windows Defender"
* Disable "Windows Firewall"
* Turn off all update downloads and checks
* Ignore the IPv6 / IP Version 6 stuff - we will only use IPv4 for this class
* It's a good idea to attach shared folders when transferring content, and detaching them when
  executing malware

For configuring virtual networks, it is important from a safety standpoint, as well as minimizing
confusion, to use "reserved private network addresses", such as those described in RFC 1918:
* [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)
