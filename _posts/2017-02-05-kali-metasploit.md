Kali Linux has Metasploit built into it. In this homework, you will select
a PDF exploit from Metasploit and build an attack with it - similar to what
we demonstrated in class during Week 02. 

You will not be able to use the *adobe_pdf_embedded_exe* exploit we used in
class. Rather, you must use one of the other exploits that targets the Adobe
Acrobat Reader software. After you’ve created the exploit PDF, you must
analyze it either using a tool of your choosing or the “pdf-parser.py” tool
I demonstrated in class (and/or other tools, if needed).

Here are some examples of PDF exploits you might use, but also utilize
“<code>search type:exploit adobe</code>” to find others. Make sure you use
the “<code>info</code>” command in Metasploit to verify your exploit is for
Adobe Acrobat Reader and not a different Adobe product.

* <code>exploit/multi/fileformat/adobe_u3d_meshcont</code>
* <code>exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_collectemailinfo</code>
* <code>exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_libtiff</code>
* <code>exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_geticon</code>
* <code>exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_flatedecode_predictor02</code>
* <code>exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_jbig2decode</code>

Another demonstration of building exploits is here:  
[CVE-2013-3346 Adobe Reader ToolButton Use After Free](http://eromang.zataz.com/2015/12/22/cve-2013-3346-adobe-reader-toolbutton-use-after-free/)

You must write a report that discusses your analysis of the exploit:

* Document the metasploit commands you used to create the attack
* Document the versions of Acrobat Reader and (where provided) Windows
  versions that it should target
* Using the pdf-parser.py utility (and/or other tools of your choosing),
  analyze the PDF structure and attempt to extract the PDF object and/or
  stream data containing the payload
* Document which object contains the exploit/payload and what
  characteristics it exhibits identifying it
* Document the encoding of the object (such as if compressed or ASCII85
  encoded) and also the underlying data type (JPEG image data? JavaScript?)

As with [Homework 01](/2017/02/05/HW01-VM-Capture.html), submit your
assignments to the appropriate blackboard submission. PDF preferred for
reports, upload any accompanying code or artifacts in a ZIP file
