This course will cover the analysis techniques that help us understand, and thus,
detect and prevent malware. Learning from the adversary is core to the science of
Cyber Security, and malware analysis is a key part of this - much as malware is a
key part of most adversary toolboxes.

### Background on Malware Analysis

Though many of the examples used in this course will involve handling benign artifacts
designed to help us learn malware analysis techniques, we may also delve into analyzing
real malware (although such artifacts will be long inactive campaigns) from the wild.
Similar to a bomb technician using special containment equipment, or a doctor using 
gear appropriate for minimizing the risk of contamination from disease, we will be using
technology to employ similar measures in this course.

There are many valuable reasons for this, but here are some of them:
1. Accidents **do** happen - you wouldn't be the first person to accidentally double-click
malware while trying to copy it.
2. Anti-virus avoidance: You neither want to fight with AV on your host, nor do you want
to disable the AV and other protections on your host system
3. You are opening up complex, unknown files, using analysis tools that are widely known.
Are you certain your tools don't have inherent vulnerabilities?
4. Often your system configuration will differ from that of the users whom you are
protecting. Setting up a lab allows us to replicate their environment without having to
adopt it.

### Work to do this week

This week, we will focus on a few core concepts working with VirtualBox and our systems.

#### ncat
Windows users may want to download the following program, `ncat.exe`, and install it somewhere
convenient:

* [ncat-portable-5.59BETA1.zip](https://nmap.org/dist/ncat-portable-5.59BETA1.zip)

Linux users should be able to install the `ncat` or `netcat` package on their favorite distribution.

The `ncat` tool is commonly used for providing a quick connection between two systems and allowing
the user to send data across the connection using the keyboard, or using other CLI programs.

#### VirtualBox Networking

By default, the OVA image I provided to you utilizes NAT networking so that it is easy to access the
Internet, install updates, and generally use. We will want to go beyond this an use VirtualBox's
"Host-only Networking" to create virtualized isolated networks within which the attacks can run. This
will require us to create a new network interface in our VM, and make configuration changes both in
Kali as well as on our host system, to create a virtual network. We will demonstrate using the virtual
networking options to achieve this.

#### VirtualBox Snapshotting

Another beneficial feature of VirtualBox is the capability of snapshotting and cloning your VM snapshots.
This allows quick & easy revert to a known-clean state, which will become beneficial later on when we may
want to experiment with various malware features and test operations. Additionally, this facilitates VM
reuse across multiple analysis projects.

#### VirtualBox Shared Folders

VirtualBox provides a simplified interface for providing access to a directory on your host system to the
underlying VM. In Linux, this is implemented using a driver and the virtual file system (VFS) that is part
of the Linux kernel. In Windows, this is implemented by masquerading as a fileserver on a local network named
**VBOXSVR**. We will familiarize ourselves with both of these interfaces.

#### Network Traffic Capture with `tcpdump` or `wireshark`

The `tcpdump` utility is the de-facto standard network traffic viewing tool, and the Wireshark tool is the
GUI counterpart to it. We will demonstrate using both of these utilities to view the content of network
traffic we generate between host & VM using `netcat`.
