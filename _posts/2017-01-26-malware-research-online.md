## {{page.title}}

This lecture discusses researching malware online, and provides some resources
for doing so.

In my opinion, the best resource available for educating oneself on security
incidents and attacks is the APTnotes archive:

*  [APTnotes (https://github.com/aptnotes)](https://github.com/aptnotes/)

The ThreatMiner project has built a nice user interface to this, as well as other,
cyber security reporting:

*  [ThreatMiner (https://threatminer.org/)](https://threatminer.org/)

Additionally, I deep dive into Malware Analysis reports published by security
research firms for two cyber threats:

### 2016 - OilRig
This is an alleged Iranian threat actor that launches complex targeted attacks. They've
been tracked since 2015, according to the source

*  [Iranian Threat Agent OilRig Delivers Digitally Signed Malware, Impersonates University of Oxford _ ClearSky Cybersecurity](https://github.com/aptnotes/data/issues/83)

### 2014 - Operations Clandestine Fox and Double Tap
This is alleged to have been carried out by a Chinese threat group with ties going back
at least a few years as of the publication of the report. The connecting relationships
between the Spring 2014 attacks and the Fall 2014 attacks are described in the malware
analysis in Operation Double Tap

### P.S.: One Additional Recommendation
Below is a link to another report, from Symantec in 2011, which I feel has a good amount
of malware analysis describing a group which used the Poison Ivy RAT heavily around that
time.
